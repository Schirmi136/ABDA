# let's see if argument construction doesn't stop too soon 
# when trying to prevent looping
a -> p
b -> -p

=> a

=> b

a, b => c
a, b => d

c, d => b

c, d => a

# when applying last-link, p should be warranted and -p should not be warranted
# this is because we can construct a strong argument for p by having c,d=>a as
# the last defeasible rule
# this illustrates that argument construction should avoid including the same
# rule (that is, including a rule that is already in a subargument) but not
# avoid including the same conclusion (that is, including a conclusion that is
# already in a subargument)
